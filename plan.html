<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 2 - Project Plan for Music Center Website </h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Sharon Antony (jc488014)</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<ul>
<li> To increase the engagment of members in activities</li>
<li> To increase the sales of the ticket</li>
<li> To increase the number of concerts and its promotion through medias </li>
</ul>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The number of the engagment of members can be evaluated by checking the number of registration for activities such as volunteering,worshops and also through the number of signups. <br> Sales can be evaluated by checking the number of people who checked the concert with the number of tickets that sold out. <br>The number of concerts can be evaluated by the number of photos and vedios uploaded by the performers.  </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>We "specialise in diversity" i.e. we provide performance opportunities for a very wide range of styles and genres which would otherwise have little exposure, therefore our target audience includes a wide range of ages and tastes. 
<br>The typical audience may include people with specialised tastes, e.g. classical, jazz, ethnic music, etc. 
<br>It is mainly aimed at the youth as they go well with the concert culture.If children are involved, then parents and family members predominate.
<br>Every concert, therefore, needs a distinctive theme. Depending on the theme we can be more specific on the type of audience.
